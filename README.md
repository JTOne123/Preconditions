# Preconditions

Preconditions provide convenience static methods that help to check that a method or a constructor is invoked with proper parameter or not. In other words it checks the *pre-conditions*.

Preconditions returns the tested value on success allowing to check and call a method at the same time.

On failure its methods throw ArgumentException.
